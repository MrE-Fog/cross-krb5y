0.3.0:
- add support for channel bindings
- major api rework. Unfortunatly I tried to simplify the api too much vs gssapi and sspi.
  it turns out, the krb5 mechanism sometimes needs to exchange more than 3 tokens, specifically in the case of an error, in order to get a readable message extra tokens need to change hands.
  I'm sorry for the churn. This rework does open the future possibility of supporting other mechanisms. Due to the complexity of doing that, and doing all the testing, I don't have an specific plans for that yet.

0.2.0:
- add support for flags. The first flag indicates that the supplied
  token is a negotiate token (only relevant on windows). The negotiate
  token will work IFF the negotiated mechanism is Kerberos.

0.1.1:
- merge patch to fix building when the iov feature is disabled (#1)
